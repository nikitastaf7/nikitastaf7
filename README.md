### :man_technologist: About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael!! It means that's my name and I like my name. But it doesn't mean that you will like it. I don't care about that? Definitely!
- 👀 I’m interested in nodrunning, web design and coding systems.
I am an active validator of all phases of the Subspace test, and also hold many other nodes, including Gear, StarkNet, SUI, etc.
Speaking of SUI. It's pretty trepidatious to keep track of every update and do it all on time, as well as keep an eye on backups.
Thank goodness the form filling is behind us. It was like a resume for a good government firm, really!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning English and trying to excel at everything related to nodraning and crypto-world.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate with other web programmers and validators because it makes me realize that I'm not such a pro.
As they say, everything is learned by comparison, and I can assure you that this is indeed true.
- 📫 How can I be contacted? Just here for now, all questions are best handled off messenger and maybe you'll agree with me. If not, so be it, I don't care.
